Room Admin Script
=====
This is meant to help administer the room, and let all users and staff have commands.

There's a reason for the folders.

About This Loader
===

The loader (as seen above) must be used to authenticate who is using this script.
If I find out that someone has taken this and not used the authenticator, I will um idk yet. But please do not take this and call it your "own".

Commands
===

If you have the minimum permission, it isn't locked in for that permission. Eg: You have manager. You can use manager, bouncer, and user commands.

Here's a breif list of what this can do:

|User|

!help
!fight
!staff
!theme
!emoji
!cookie
!ba
!link
!ask

|Bouncer|

!check
!mute
!lock
!unlock
!lskip
!wlclear * MUST HAVE UNLOCKED WAITLIST *
!clear
!skip

Other Stuff
===
If there is an error within the command, the bot will recognize, and say in chat: what time it ocurred, and the error. Really only useful for me and admins.

Also, the loader gets the current room your in.

Cheers,
